The chosen company for investment is Goodles, due to its exceptional growth trajectory and innovative appeal in the health-focused food sector, highlighted by a substantial $13 million funding round and significant market differentiation.

The companies that were not selected are:

1. **Vitto by Atlante Srl**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting:** While Vitto shows strong potential in the healthy convenience food market, it is still emerging and less established compared to Goodles. The scale of growth and market recognition has not yet reached the level required for immediate investment consideration.

2. **Elma Farms**
   - **Reason for Not Selecting:** Elma Farms offers a compelling product range and strong backing through the Endeavor network, but it lacks the remarkable growth metrics and market presence that Goodles has demonstrated, making it a less favorable option for immediate investment.
